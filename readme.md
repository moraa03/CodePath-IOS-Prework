Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
**Productivity Tracker** is an app that merges both the Calendar and the To do List Apps, where you can check off the activities you have completed for the day and get a percentage score increase in productivity tracking, and the checked off items disappear/crossed off the calendar. At the end of the day there is a productivity analysis and you can add friends and family to compare and compete in completing tasks. 
## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
